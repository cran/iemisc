#' Modified Rational Method Equation
#'
#' Computes the design peak runoff rate (Q) using the modified rational method
#' equation.
#'
#'
#'
#' @param C_F numeric vector that contains the "runoff coefficient adjustment
#'    factor to account for reduction of infiltration and other losses during
#'    high intensity storms" [Input a number between 2 and 10; 25; 50; or 100]
#' @param C numeric vector that contains the dimensionless "runoff coefficient
#'    to reflect the ratio of rainfall to surface runoff"
#' @param i numeric vector that contains the "rainfall intensity in inches per
#'    hour (in/hr)"
#' @param A numeric vector that contains the drainage area in one of the
#'    area_units values.
#' @param area_units character vector containing the units for area
#'    (default = "acre"). The other possible units are "square feet",
#'    "square mile", "hectare", or "square kilometer".
#'
#'
#'
#' @return the numeric vector Q, which is the "peak flow" in cubic feet per
#'    second (cfs or ft^3/s)

#'
#' @note
#' Please note: Refer to the limitations of the Modified Rational Method
#' equation for your particular jurisdiction. Notes are only included below for
#' Oklahoma and Oregon, respectively.
#' 
#' for Oklahoma
#' "The Rational Method, first introduced in 1889, is recommended for estimating
#' the design storm peak runoff for areas up to 640 acres. The Rational Method
#' was modified in the 1980's to include a runoff coefficient correction tied to
#' the flood frequency. This Modified Rational Method is used by ODOT.
#' 
#' Some precautions should be considered when applying the Rational method:
#' --The first step in applying the Rational method is to obtain a good
#' topographic map and define the boundaries of the drainage area in question. A
#' field inspection of the area should also be made to determine if the natural
#' drainage divides have been altered.
#' --In determining surface characteristics for the drainage area, consider any
#' future changes in land use that might occur during the service life of the
#' proposed facility that could result in an inadequate drainage system. Also,
#' the effects of upstream detention facilities may be considered.
#' --Restrictions to the natural flow (e.g., highway crossings and dams that
#' exist in the drainage area) should be investigated to determine how they
#' might affect the design flows.
#' --The charts, graphs and tables included in this Section are not intended to
#' replace reasonable and prudent engineering judgment that should permeate
#' each step in the design process." [Oklahoma Department of Transportation
#' Reference]
#' 
#' 
#' for Oregon:
#' "Limitations and assumptions in the Rational Method are as follows:
#' --The drainage area should not be larger than 200 acres.
#' --The peak flow is assumed to occur when the entire watershed is contributing runoff.
#' --The rainfall intensity is assumed to be uniform over a time duration equal to or
#' greater than the time of concentration, Tc.
#' --The peak flow recurrence interval is assumed to be equal to the rainfall intensity
#' recurrence interval. In other words, the 10-year rainfall intensity is assumed to
#' produce the 10-year flood." [Oregon Department of Transportation Reference]
#'
#' The value of 1.008 is used for the unit conversion factor for English units.

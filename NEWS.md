# iemisc 1.0.5 (5 June 2024)

* Re-submitted the package due to the removal & readmittal of the `iemiscdata` package.
* Replaced as.numeric with drop_units in the engr_survey function. Made other revisions in the engr_survey & engr_survey_reverse functions.
* Revised the reduce_single_digit function to allow for dates with /s


# iemisc 1.0.4 (25 September 2023)

* Received an e-mail issue from Kurt Hornik on 19 August 2023 regarding the use of "@docType package" which is no longer valid. Replaced the iemisc.R file with iemisc-package.R to reflect the requested change.
* Added the `chem.databases` package to Imports to replace `CHNOSZ` which has been removed from Imports
* Added `printr` to Suggests to allow the printing of help functions in the vignettes & added `tibble` and `lintr` to Suggests
* Modified the Help section on the README again & Added the additional available function to the README
* Revised the URL for Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds Technical Release 55 (TR-55) in the weighted_CN function Reference. Revised various other URLs to get `iemisc` accepted into CRAN. Used the ResearchGate version of certain articles or the Internet Archive: Wayback Machine archive for other URLs that had issues.
* Revised the air_stripper function to search for the CAS Number in the atsdr_tsca_ld50_a data set of the `chem.databases` package. Also revised the package to obtain the molecular formulas and average mass from the chem_wiki data set of the `chem.databases` package
* Added the "%inorder%" function to return character vectors in a given sequence
* Added the c_composite_CN function for connected impervious areas
* Added the uc_composite_CN function for unconnected impervious areas
* Replaced the T for temperature variable with Temp for temperature in all functions after doing a `lintr` check on the package to attempt to locate an error causing the references not to be valid in the Manningtrap function
* Added an additional contributor for the "%inorder%" function
* Created the Sound Frequencies & Nikola Tesla&#8217;s 3-6-9 Theory vignette and modified all other vignettes. The most significant revisions were made in the Comparing Other Hydraulic Software Output to iemisc&#8217;s Manningtrap for Critical Conditions & Construction Measurement Examples vignettes


# iemisc 1.0.3 (3 May 2023)

* Modified the Help section and the package introduction on the README
* Revised the non-standard evaluation of library calls to standard evaluation calls in the README and in all functions
* Revised some grammatical issues in various functions
* Revised the splitcomma function to allow for a set of names in a single character vector to be separated by " & "
* Revised the reduce_single_digit function to allow for date times and vectors with decimals
* Revised all of the vignettes -- removed the PNG image for the Creative Commons license due to it failing consistently on certain OSes. Also added the EcoCÂ²S services link to all of the vignettes as well.
* Added the notchin function (Negate chin from `data.table` and Negate in from `base` R) to determine which character or numeric vectors are not in a set of character or numeric vectors
* Added the surface_area (for calculating the linear surface area) & rain_garden_driveway (for sizing a rain garden based on driveway surface areas) functions
* Removed `qdapTools` from Imports as Prof Brian Ripley sent an e-mail that `qdapTools` is scheduled for archival on 6 May 2023 due to failing the CRAN checks. The lookupQT (lookup in `qdapTools`) and lookup_helperQT (lookup_helper in `qdapTools`) functions have been added to the package to avoid `iemisc` from being archived on that date too. The existing functions have been modified to use lookupQT instead of lookup.


# iemisc 1.0.2 (4 March 2023)

* CRAN update to move from archived back to active state
* Added `formatR` to Suggests to fix the CRAN ERROR message on certain systems & added `pander` to Suggests to print better LaTeX tables for the vignettes. Some of the tables in the vignettes are created using kable from `knitr`.

* Added a check in the frac_to_numeric function to issue an error message when the length of n > 1 exists to correct the failed tests on some systems
* Added both author and encoding fields to the various functions where those 2 items were missing [f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, kin_visc_water, lat_long2utm, Manningcircy, Manningtrap_critical, Re2, Re3, Re4]
* Added more assert_that clauses to both the weighted_CN and weighted_C functions
* Modified the vignette encoding for all of the vignettes
* Added the rational_equation function which calculates the peak flow using the modified rational method equation

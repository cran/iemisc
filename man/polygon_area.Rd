\title{Polygon Area (using the Shoelace Formula)}
\usage{
polygon_area(x, y, plot = c(0, 1), fill = NULL, color = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector that contains the x coordinates of the vertices.
Regardless of rather the user starts in a clockwise or a counter-clockwise
direction, the result will be positive.}

\item{y}{numeric vector that contains the y coordinates of the vertices.
Regardless of rather the user starts in a clockwise or a counter-clockwise
direction, the result will be positive.}

\item{plot}{integer vector that contains 0, 1 only. 0 represents
do not plot the polygon and 1 is for plotting the polygon.}

\item{fill}{character vector that contains the inside color of the polygon.
The possible colors are those that are accepted by ggplot2. The default
fill color is black.}

\item{color}{character vector that the border color of the polygon. The
possible colors are those that are accepted by ggplot2. The default fill
color is black.}
}
\value{
the area of the polygon as a positive numeric vector.
}
\description{
Calculate the area of a polygon using the shoelace formula.

# compare with pracma's and geometry's polyarea

pracma::polyarea(x, y)

geometry::polyarea(x, y)





# Example 2

library("iemisc")

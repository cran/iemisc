\title{Saturation Vapor Pressure for Water}
\usage{
sat_vapor_pressure(
  Temp,
  units = c("SI", "Eng", "Absolute"),
  formula = c("Huang", "Buck", "IAPWS")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Temp}{numeric vector that contains the temperature (degrees Celsius,
degrees Fahrenheit, or Kelvin)}

\item{units}{character vector that contains the system of units (options are
\code{SI} for International System of Units, \code{Eng} for English units
(United States Customary System in the United States and Imperial Units in
the United Kingdom), or \code{Absolute} for Absolute Units)}

\item{formula}{character vector that contains the source of the formula used
to compute the saturation vapor pressure (options are Huang, Buck, IAPWS)}
}
\value{
the saturation vapor pressure for water as a numeric vector. The unit
  for \code{SI} and \code{Absolute} is Pascal (Pa), but the unit for \code{Eng}
  is pounds per square inch (psi). The units are not returned.
}
\description{
This function solves for the saturation vapor pressure of water using only
the temperature of the water in either units of degrees Celsius, degrees
Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
}
\details{
The simplified equation is expressed as

\deqn{P_s = \exp{\frac{34.494 - \frac{4924.99}{t + 237.1}}{(t + 105)^1.57}}}

for (t > 0 C)

\describe{
  \item{\emph{P_s}}{the saturation vapor pressure (Pa or psi)}
  \item{\emph{t}}{the water temperature, degrees Celsius}
}
}
\note{
Note: Please refer to the references for the formulas (Huang = Reference 1,
IAPWS = Reference 2, and Buck = Reference 3)

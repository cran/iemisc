\usage{
igivenICPn(P, IC, n = NULL, begin_event = NULL, end_event = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{numeric vector that contains the principal value}

\item{IC}{numeric vector that contains the total amount of interest charged}

\item{n}{numeric vector that contains the number of years}

\item{begin_event}{character vector that contains the start date}

\item{end_event}{character vector that contains the end date}
}
\value{
i numeric vector that contains the simple interest rate as a
percent rounded to 2 decimal places
}
\description{
Compute i given IC, n, and P
}
\details{
i is expressed as

	\deqn{i = {\frac{IC * 100}{P * n}}}

\describe{
\item{\emph{i}}{the interest rate}
\item{\emph{IC}}{the total amount of interest charged}
\item{\emph{P}}{the principal amount of the loan}
\item{\emph{n}}{the number of years}
}
}

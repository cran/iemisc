\description{
Computes the design peak runoff rate (Q) using the modified rational method
equation.

\note{
Please note: Refer to the limitations of the Modified Rational Method
equation for your particular jurisdiction. Notes are only included below for
Oklahoma and Oregon, respectively.

for Oklahoma
"The Rational Method, first introduced in 1889, is recommended for estimating
the design storm peak runoff for areas up to 640 acres. The Rational Method
was modified in the 1980's to include a runoff coefficient correction tied to
the flood frequency. This Modified Rational Method is used by ODOT.

Some precautions should be considered when applying the Rational method:
--The first step in applying the Rational method is to obtain a good
topographic map and define the boundaries of the drainage area in question. A
field inspection of the area should also be made to determine if the natural
drainage divides have been altered.
--In determining surface characteristics for the drainage area, consider any
future changes in land use that might occur during the service life of the
proposed facility that could result in an inadequate drainage system. Also,
the effects of upstream detention facilities may be considered.
--Restrictions to the natural flow (e.g., highway crossings and dams that
exist in the drainage area) should be investigated to determine how they
might affect the design flows.
--The charts, graphs and tables included in this Section are not intended to
replace reasonable and prudent engineering judgment that should permeate
each step in the design process." [Oklahoma Department of Transportation
Reference]


for Oregon:
"Limitations and assumptions in the Rational Method are as follows:
--The drainage area should not be larger than 200 acres.
--The peak flow is assumed to occur when the entire watershed is contributing runoff.
--The rainfall intensity is assumed to be uniform over a time duration equal to or
greater than the time of concentration, Tc.
--The peak flow recurrence interval is assumed to be equal to the rainfall intensity
recurrence interval. In other words, the 10-year rainfall intensity is assumed to
produce the 10-year flood." [Oregon Department of Transportation Reference]

The value of 1.008 is used for the unit conversion factor for English units.

# 3 acres = streets (concrete)
# Soil = clay loam
# Tc = 20 min (time of concentration)

# Find the instantaneous peak discharge for a 25-yr frequency flood at a
# road crossing in an urban/rural area located in the Kansas City, Missouri
# area.

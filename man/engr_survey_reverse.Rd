\usage{
engr_survey_reverse(
  latitude,
  longitude,
  units = c("survey_ft", "foot", "meters"),
  location = c("KY", "TN"),
  output = c("basic", "table"),
  utm = c(0, 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{latitude}{numeric vector {or character vector with spaces, degree
symbol, single quotation mark, and/or escaped quotation mark (\")} that
contains the latitude coordinate point. The following possibilities are
valid: -25.02, "25\\U00B056'50.2068\"N"; "15\\U00B056'58.7068"; "37'1'54.3'N";
"35 8 46.44496",  "35'8'46.44496". If the North designation is not
provided, then it will be added. The latitude/longitude coordinate pair
has to be either a numeric or character vector (no mixing).}

\item{longitude}{numeric vector {or character vector with spaces, degree
symbol, single quotation mark, and/or escaped quotation mark (\")} that
contains the latitude coordinate point. The following possibilities are
valid: 09.83, "25\\U00B056'50.2068\"W"; "15\\U00B056'58.7068"; "37'1'54.3'E";
"35 8 46.44496",  "35'8'46.44496". If the West designation is not
provided, then it will be added. The latitude/longitude coordinate pair
has to be either a numeric or character vector (no mixing).}

\item{units}{character vector that contains the system of units (options are
\code{survey_ft} (United States Customary System) [US survey foot],
\code{foot}, or \code{meters} (International System of Units) [meters]}

\item{location}{character vector that contains the location name ('KY' for
Kentucky or 'TN' for Tennessee)}

\item{output}{character vector that contains basic for the default result
using a simple \code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} or table for the result as a
complex \code{\link[data.table]{data.table}}}

\item{utm}{numeric vector that contains 0 or 1 only. 0 represents do not
provide the utm coordinates and 1 is to provide the utm coordinates}
}
\value{
the geodetic coordinates as projected SPCS Northing and Easting
   coordinates as a \code{\link[data.table]{data.table}}
}
\description{
Takes geodetic coordinates of the World Geodetic System (WGS) (19)84
(EPSG:4326) [MapTiler Reference] and converts those values into Kentucky or
Tennessee-based Northing and Easting engineering survey measurements
[based in the State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS)] in meters, international
foot, or US survey foot. Each latitude {Y} and longitude {X} point is
verified to be located within Kentucky or Tennessee.
}
\note{
Please Note: If you have Kentucky North/South Zone survey measurements, then
please use the Kentucky Geological Survey, University of Kentucky - Kentucky
Single Coordinate Conversion Tool
(http://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/CoordConversionTool.asp) instead. That tool will
give you the geographic coordinates too. This R function, engr_survey_reverse will
only be valid for NAD83 / Kentucky Single Zone.

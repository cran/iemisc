period as a percent for option 2}

\item{salvage2}{numeric vector that contains the salvage value for option 2}

\item{option1}{character vector that contains the name of option for
option 1}

\item{option2}{character vector that contains the name of option for
option 2}

\item{table}{character vector that contains the table output format
(ptable, rtable, or both)}
}
\value{
\code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} with character vectors with the monetary
values having thousands separator in a pretty table (ptable) & message with
the best option, data.frame with numeric vectors without the thousands
separator in regular table (rtable) & a message with the best option, or both
options combined in a list

\description{
Compute the benefit-cost ratio between two alternatives
}
\details{
Benefit is expressed as

\deqn{Benefit = AB\left[\frac{\left(1 + i\right)^n - 1}{i\left(1 + i\right)^n}\right]}

\describe{
\item{\emph{Benefit}}{the present equivalent benefit}
\item{\emph{AB}}{the annual benefit}
\item{\emph{i}}{the "effective interest rate" per year}
\item{\emph{n}}{the number of years}
}



Cost is expressed as

\deqn{Cost = PC + OM\left[\frac{\left(1 + i\right)^n - 1}{i\left(1 + i\right)^n}\right] - S\left[\frac{1}{\left(1 + i\right)^n}\right]}

\describe{
\item{\emph{Cost}}{the present equivalent cost}
\item{\emph{PC}}{the present or initial cost}
\item{\emph{OM}}{the annual operations & maintenance cost}
\item{\emph{S}}{the salvage value}
\item{\emph{i}}{the "effective interest rate" per year}
\item{\emph{n}}{the number of years}
}



Benefit-Cost ratio is expressed as

\deqn{BC = \frac{B_2 - B_1}{C_2 - C_1} \geq 1}

\describe{
\item{\emph{BC}}{the present equivalent cost}
\item{\emph{\eqn{B_1}}}{the benefit for alternative 1}
\item{\emph{\eqn{B_2}}}{the benefit for alternative 2}
\item{\emph{\eqn{C_1}}}{the cost for alternative 1}
\item{\emph{\eqn{C_2}}}{the cost for alternative 2}

# About the examples

The following examples only cover open channel flow problems using the Gauckler-Manning-Strickler equation to calculate the missing parameters and the determination of the critical depth.

<br />
<br />

# Examples

<br />
<br />

## rectangular cross-section

```{r}
library(install.load)
load_package("iemisc", "iemiscdata", "rivr") # load needed packages using the load_package function from the install.load package (it is assumed that you have already installed these packages)


# 1) Practice Problem 14.10 from Mott (page 391-392)

# What is the Q (discharge) for this cross-section?

# See nchannel in iemiscdata for the Manning's n table that the following example uses
# Use the normal Manning's n value for Natural streams - minor streams (top width at floodstage < 100 ft), Lined or Constructed Channels, Concrete, and unfinished.

# The 1st heading is "Manning's n for Channels"
# The 2nd heading is "Natural streams - minor streams (top width at floodstage < 100 ft)"
# The 3rd heading is "Lined or Constructed Channels,"
# The 4th heading is "Concrete"
# The 5th heading is "unfinished"


data(nchannel)
# load the data set nchannel from iemiscdata

nlocation <- grep("unfinished", nchannel$"Type of Channel and Description")
# search for the term "unfinished" in the "Type of Channel and Description" column in the nchannel data set

nlocation

n <- nchannel[nlocation, 3] # 3 for column 3 - Normal n
# the value of n will be found in column 3 at the location specified by nlocation

n

Q <- Manningrect(b = 3.5, y = 2, Sf = 0.1/100, n = n, units = "SI")
# b = 3.5 m, y = 2 m, Sf = 0.1 percent m/m, n = 0.017, units = SI units
# This will solve for Q since it is missing and Q will be in m^3/s

Q


# What is the critical depth for this given discharge?

critical_depth(Q$Q, 2, 9.80665, 3.5, 0)


# 2) Problem 1 from Hauser (page 88)

# What is the Sf (slope) for this cross-section?

Sf <- Manningrect(Q = 6.25 * 8 * 14.9, b = 8, y = 6.25, n = 0.01, units = "Eng")
# Q = 6.25 ft * 8 ft * 14.9 ft/sec, b = 8 ft, y = 6.25 ft, n = 0.01, units = Eng units
# This will solve for Sf since it is missing and Sf will be in ft/ft

Sf


# What is the critical depth for this given discharge?

critical_depth(6.25 * 8 * 14.9, 6.25, 9.80665 * (3937 / 1200), 8, 0)

# What is the y (flow depth) for this cross-section?

# See nchannel in iemiscdata for the Manning's n table that the following example uses

# The 1st heading is "Manning's n for Channels"
# The 2nd heading is "Natural streams - minor streams (top width at floodstage < 100 ft)"
# The 3rd heading is "Lined or Constructed Channels,"
# The 4th heading is "Concrete"
# The 5th heading is "unfinished"

# Q = 150 cfs, b = 4 ft, m = 2, Sf = 2/100 ft/ft, n = 0.030, units = Eng units

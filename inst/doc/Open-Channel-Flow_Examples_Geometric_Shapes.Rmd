# About the examples

The following examples only cover open channel flow problems using the Gauckler-Manning-Strickler equation (commonly called Manning's equation) [Wikimedia] to calculate the missing parameters and the critical depth.  

Other examples using the Gauckler-Manning-Strickler equation can be found at [Open Channel Flow Examples using the Gauckler-Manning-Strickler equation](https://www.ecoccs.com/R_Examples/open_channel_flow.html) written by the author.

# Examples

## rectangular cross-section

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, tidy = TRUE}
install.load::load_package("iemisc", "iemiscdata", "rivr", "pander")
# load needed packages using the load_package function from the install.load package (it is assumed that you have already installed these packages)


# 1) Practice Problem 14.10 from Mott (pages 391-392)

# What is the Q (discharge) for this cross-section?

# See nchannel in iemiscdata for the Manning's n table that the following example uses
# Use the normal Manning's n value for Natural streams - minor streams (top width at floodstage < 100 ft), Lined or Constructed Channels, Concrete, and unfinished.

# The 1st heading is "Manning's n for Channels"
# The 2nd heading is "Natural streams - minor streams (top width at floodstage < 100 ft)"
# The 3rd heading is "Lined or Constructed Channels,"
# The 4th heading is "Concrete"
# The 5th heading is "unfinished"


data(nchannel)
# load the data set nchannel from iemiscdata

nlocation <- grep("unfinished", nchannel$"Type of Channel and Description")
# search for the term "unfinished" in the "Type of Channel and Description" column in the nchannel data set

# the value of n will be found in column 3 at the location specified by nlocation

# b = 3.5 m, y = 2 m, Sf = 0.1 percent m/m, n = 0.017, units = SI units
# This will solve for Q since it is missing and Q will be in m^3/s

# What is the critical depth for this given discharge?
